# ERRSA MC — Operational Review & Navigation

This page provides a single entry point to all operational documentation
for the ERRSA Minecraft server.

If you are reviewing, onboarding, or taking over responsibility,
start here.

## Core training modules

These modules explain **how the server works** and **how authority is structured**.

1. **[Module 1 — Server Architecture & Authority Model](lessons-path/mod1.md)**  
   How permissions, identity, and authority are intentionally separated.

2. **[Module 2 — Core Systems & Player Flow](lessons-path/mod2.md)**  
   How players move from first join to survival gameplay.

3. **[Module 3 — Core Operational Plugins](lessons-path/mod3.md)**  
   Which plugins are core, what they own, and how to diagnose issues.

4. **[Module 4 — Documentation, Change Control & Incident Context](lessons-path/mod4.md)**  
   Which document governs which action and how to operate safely.

5. **[Module 5 — Advanced Systems & Developer Responsibility](lessons-path/mod5.md)**  
   High-risk systems, long-term responsibility, and trust boundaries.

## Authoritative documents (official)

These documents define **authority, procedure, and records**.
If there is ever a conflict, these take precedence over the wiki.

- 📘 **[ERRSA MC Staff Documentation](ERRSA MC Staff Documentation.pdf)**  
  Authority, roles, procedures, escalation, and moderation rules.

- 🧾 **[ERRSA MC Moderation Log](ERRSA MC Moderation Log.pdf)**  
  Record of all player-facing enforcement actions.

- 🛠️ **[ERRSA MC Server Changelog](ERRSA MC Server Changelog.pdf)**  
  Record of all system and configuration changes.

---

## Reference sections

These pages are used **as needed**, not read linearly.

- **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)**  
  Orientation, system overview, and safety rules.

- **[Permissions Model](standards/permissions.md)**  
  Detailed explanation of MAIN / ERRSA / STAFF tracks.

- **[Plugins](plugins/index.md)**  
  Per-plugin reference documentation.

- **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/index.md)**  
  Common failures and where to look first.

## Review checklist (for handoff or audit)

You are ready to operate or take over the server if you can:

- Identify which document governs a given situation
- Trace a player from first join → survival
- Name the core operational plugins and their responsibilities
- Follow change control without improvising
- Escalate instead of guessing

## Final note

This wiki explains **how the server works**.  
The official documents define **what you are allowed to do**.

Use both correctly.
