# Module 4 — Documentation, Change Control, & Incident Context

## Purpose

This module explains **which official documents govern which actions**
on the ERRSA Minecraft server, and how to use them correctly.

This module is a **guide**, not a source of authority.

- All **procedures, punishments, and staff actions** are defined in official documentation.
- All **player-facing enforcement** is recorded in official logs.
- All **server changes** are recorded in official changelogs.

This module teaches *how those documents work together*.

!!! warning
    If there is ever a conflict between this module and an official document,** the official document always takes   precedence.**

## The authoritative documents

The ERRSA MC server is governed by three official documents.
Each has a distinct purpose and authority.

### ERRSA Minecraft Staff Documentation
_(Authority & Procedure)_

**What it governs:**

 - Staff roles and chain of command
 - Conduct expectations
 - Moderation procedures
 - Punishments, appeals, and escalation
 - Logging requirements

**What it answers:**

 - _“What am I allowed to do?”_
 - _“What is the correct procedure?”_
 - _“How should this situation be handled?”_

 **Official authority:**

### ERRSA MC Moderation Log
_(Record of Player-Facing Actions)_

**What it records:**

 - Warnings
 - Mutes, kicks, bans
 - Administrative actions affecting players
 - Evidence and notes tied to enforcement

**What it answers:**

 - “What action was taken against a player?”
 - “When and why did it happen?”
 - “Who took the action?”

**Official record:**

### ERRSA MC Server Changelog
_(Record of System Changes)_

**What it records:**

 - Plugin additions and updates
 - Configuration changes
 - Infrastructure changes
 - Version history

**What it answers:**

 - “What changed on the server?”
 - “When did it change?”
 - “Why was it changed?”

**Official record:**

## Where this module fits

This module does **not**:

- Define punishments
- Authorize staff actions
- Replace official procedures
- Serve as a log

This module **does**:

- Explain which document to use
- Reinforce documentation discipline
- Provide context for safe operation
- Teach judgment and escalation

!!! info
Think of this module as a map, not a rulebook.

## Which document do I use?

| Situation | Use this document |
|--------|----------------|
| Player broke a rule | Staff Documentation |
| Issuing a warning / ban | Moderation Log |
| Player appeals a ban | Staff Documentation |
| Plugin updated | Server Changelog |
| Config changed | Server Changelog |
| Server behaves differently | Server Changelog |
| Unsure how to handle a situation | Staff Documentation |
| Investigating past staff action | Moderation Log |

If you are unsure, do not guess — escalate following the Staff Documentation.

## Change control (document-driven)

Any change to server behavior must:

1. Follow the Staff Documentation’s authority structure
2. Be recorded in the Server Changelog
3. Be executed with a verified backup

## Incident or change?

 **Incident**
 
  - Player-facing
  - Unplanned
  - Logged in the Moderation Log
  - Governed by Staff Documentation

 **Change**
  
  - System-facing
  - Planned or corrective
  - Logged in the Server Changelog
  - Governed by Staff Documentation authority

## Escalation

All escalation paths are defined in the Staff Documentation.

When unsure:

- Do not improvise
- Do not bypass documentation
- Escalate upward

## Module 4 completion check

You have completed this module if you can:

- Identify which document governs a given situation
- Explain the difference between authority, procedure, and record
- Use the correct document without improvising
- Escalate instead of acting when unsure


## Completion

Modules 1–4 establish the **baseline operational knowledge**
required to safely participate in ERRSA MC server administration.

Advanced topics and specialization follow from here.
