# Module 1 Purpose

## Purpose

This module explains how the ERRSA Minecraft server is *intentionally structured*.
Before learning commands, plugins, or configs, you must understand how authority, identity, and gameplay access are separated.

This module answers one question:
**“Who is allowed to do what — and why?”**

!!! info "You do not need to memorize this module."
You need to understand the boundaries it defines.

## Core principle

The ERRSA MC server uses **parallel authority tracks**, not a single permission ladder.

Belonging to one track **never** grants power in another.

## The three parallel tracks

Each player exists simultaneously in three independent systems:

- **MAIN** — Can this player interact with gameplay?
- **ERRSA** — Who is this player within the organization?
- **STAFF** — What authority does this player have over others?

!!! key "Membership in one track **never** implies membership or authority in another."

## MAIN track — Player lifecycle

The MAIN track controls whether a player can interact with the server at all.
It does **not** control authority or organizational status.

## ERRSA track — Organization & identity

The ERRSA track represents a player’s identity *within the organization*, not their power on the server.
Examples:

  -Executive board members
  -Hall representatives
  -Legacy members
  -Advisor

### Purpose
- Prefixes and recognition
- Organizational identity
- Historical or honorary roles

!!! Note "ERRSA roles **never** grant moderation, admin, or developer permissions."

## STAFF track — Authority

The STAFF track controls actions that affect other players or the server itself.

### Levels (conceptual only)

  - Moderator
    - Rule enforcement
    - Investigations
    - Muting / kicking / banning
  - Admin
    - Incident resolution
    - Rollbacks and overrides
    - Server stability actions
  - Developer
    - Plugins and configs
    - Permissions architecture
    - Backend systems

## Escalation logic (conceptual)

- Player behavior issues → Moderator
- Server damage or incidents → Admin
- Plugin, config, or permissions issues → Developer

If you are unsure which track an issue belongs to, escalate upward rather than acting.

## You have completed this module if you can:

- Explain why VIP status does not grant staff authority
- Identify which track a problem belongs to
- Know when **not** to act and escalate instead
- Describe the difference between identity and authority
