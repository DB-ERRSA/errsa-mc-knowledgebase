# Getting Started

## Who this is for
Future developers and admins maintaining the ERRSA MC server.

## Where things live
- Host: Apex Hosting
- Panel: (add link/instructions)
- Backups: (describe location + cadence)
- Database: phpMyAdmin (or other)

## Golden rules
1. Don’t edit production without a backup.
2. Document every plugin change here (add update doc).
3. Never give players permissions directly—use groups.
