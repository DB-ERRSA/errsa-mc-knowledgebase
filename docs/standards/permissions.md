## Permissions philosophy

Permissions on the ERRSA Minecraft server are structured to reflect **roles and responsibilities**, not seniority or trust alone.

Staff permissions are intentionally separated to ensure:

- accountability
- safety
- clear escalation paths
- separation of technical and non-technical authority

This structure mirrors the official ERRSA MC Staff Documentation.

## Staff permission tracks

The server uses three staff permission tiers, aligned with ERRSA policy:

- **Moderator** — rule enforcement and player safety
- **Admin** — operational management and escalation (super-mod)
- **Developer** — technical ownership and implementation

### Moderator

**Role**: Front-line rule enforcement  
**Focus**: Player behavior and community safety

Allowed:

- Warnings, mutes, kicks, bans (per procedure)
- Teleport tools for moderation
- Investigation commands (read-only)
- Chat and sign moderation

Not allowed:

- Creative mode
- World modification
- Plugin interaction
- Permission management
- Config changes

### Admin

**Role**: Operational management  
**Focus**: Escalation, investigation, coordination

Admins exist to support Developers by handling **non-technical server management**.

Allowed:

- All Moderator permissions
- Investigation tools (CoreProtect, rollbacks)
