## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Bedrock players can’t click links (Discord/Feedback/Report).
**Likely cause:** Expected behavior-Bedrock is given plain text links by design.

**Fix:** Tell Bedrock players to copy/paste the link into a browser; keep links short and stable.

**Escalate if:** Java players also lose clickability-check chat formatting plugins that might strip click events.
