# SilkSpawners V2

## Purpose

   **Category:** `Gameplay`  

   SilkSpawners allows mob spawners to be broken and picked up, then placed again later as items.  
   On ERRSA MC, this gives players controlled access to moving spawners while keeping configuration and administrative spawner editing restricted to staff.
