# Geyser

## Purpose

**Category:** `Core & Infrastructure`

Geyser allows **Bedrock Edition clients** to connect to the ERRSA MC Java server by translating Bedrock network traffic into Java-compatible packets.

Geyser does not modify gameplay rules, permissions, or authority; it only provides protocol compatibility.
