# InvisibleFrames

## Purpose

   **Category:** `Cosmetics`  

   Allows players to toggle item frames between visible and invisible using a simple in-game interaction.  
   On ERRSA MC, this is used as a small quality-of-life feature for decorating builds without requiring admin intervention.

## ERRSA Defaults & Settings

!!! note "ERRSA-specific configuration choices"
- `lock-frame: true` — invisible item frames are locked while hidden so they cannot be easily broken or knocked off by accident
- `toggle-empty: false` — prevents players from creating random invisible empty frames around the server
- `blacklisted-items: []` — no item blacklist is currently configured
- `Permission granted:` `invisibleframes.toggleframes` — assigned to the `user` group so normal players can use the feature for building/decorating
