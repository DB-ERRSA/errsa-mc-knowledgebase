# Quickshop Hikari

## Purpose

   **Category:** `Gameplay` / `Economy`

   QuickShop-Hikari allows players to create chest-based player shops for buying and selling items through the in-game economy.  
   On ERRSA MC, it is used to support a simple player-driven marketplace while still preserving shop protection, logging, and staff visibility into suspicious activity.
