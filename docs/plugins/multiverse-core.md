# Multiverse-Core

## Purpose

**Category:** `Infrastructure`

Multiverse-Core manages multiple worlds on ERRSA MC, including world loading, world-specific gameplay rules, respawn behavior, teleport handling, and per-world environment settings. On ERRSA MC, it is used to maintain the main survival worlds as well as controlled-purpose worlds like `Lobby`, `PlayerInit`, and `LegacyLake`.

## Dependencies

!!! info "Required for this plugin to function"
- **Server:** Paper / Spigot
- **Plugins:**
  - `Multiverse-Core`

## Permissions Model

!!! note "Permissions are intentionally scoped"
    This plugin follows the **parallel permission track model**.  
    Access is granted by role, not convenience.


### Dev permissions
- Multiverse-Core access is restricted to **dev/trusted infrastructure staff only**

!!! warning
    World creation, import, teleport routing, and respawn configuration can affect the entire server.  
    Treat Multiverse-Core as a restricted infrastructure tool.

- `world_the_end` — survival end, hard difficulty, PvP enabled, scale `16.0` 

### Controlled / custom worlds
- `Lobby` — adventure mode, PvP off, monsters/animals/misc spawning disabled, weather allowed, keep spawn in memory enabled
- `PlayerInit` — adventure mode, peaceful, hunger off, PvP off, respawn-world set to `PlayerInit`
- `LegacyLake` — adventure mode, peaceful, hunger off, PvP off, weather off, keep spawn in memory disabled

## ERRSA Design Intent

!!! note "Why these settings exist"

- Multiverse is being used as a **world governance layer**, not as a general player utility plugin
- Main worlds preserve normal survival gameplay
- Purpose-built worlds like `Lobby`, `PlayerInit`, and `LegacyLake` are locked down with adventure mode, low/no hostile pressure, and reduced survival mechanics
- Join-spawn override is disabled globally, so Multiverse is not forcing all login routing by itself
- Respawn logic is conservative and world-aware, with overworld fallback enabled and respawn-at-world-spawn enforced globally unless world properties override it
