# GriefPrevention

## Purpose

**Category:** Protection

GriefPrevention allows players to **claim land and protect their builds, chests, and structures from modification by other players**. On ERRSA MC, it serves as the primary system preventing violations of **Rule [4] — Do not destroy, steal, or damage another player's builds, property, or creations.**

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "My chest / house / farm got griefed even though I thought it was protected"

**Likely cause:**  
The area was **not actually claimed**, the claim was too small, or the affected part of the build was placed **outside the claim boundary**.

**Fix:**  
1. Have the player hold the **stick** to view claim boundaries.  
2. Confirm the build is fully inside the claim.  
3. If needed, tell the player to expand the claim or create a new one with `/claim`.  
4. If damage already occurred, investigate with CoreProtect.

**Escalate if:**  
- The player insists the build was inside a claim  
- Multiple protection systems appear to be conflicting  
- Claim boundaries are behaving incorrectly

---

### Issue: "I can't open a chest / door / gate in someone else's claim"

**Likely cause:**  
The player does not have the required **trust level** in that claim.

**Fix:**  
- Claim owner should use the correct trust command:
  - `/trust <player>` — build access
  - `/containertrust <player>` — container access
  - `/accesstrust <player>` — access to doors, buttons, etc.
- If the player is only visiting, this is normal protection behavior.

**Escalate if:**  
- The player should already have trust but still cannot interact  
- Permissions fail after being re-applied

---

### Issue: "I’m stuck inside someone’s claim"

**Likely cause:**  
The player entered or spawned into a protected area without access.

**Fix:**  
- Have the player use `/trapped` if available.
- If they remain stuck, staff can assist manually.

**Escalate if:**  
- `/trapped` fails
- The player is stuck in an **admin claim**
- The issue happens repeatedly in the same location

---

### Issue: "I can’t place lava / use ender pearls / trigger raids near claims"

**Likely cause:**  
ERRSA MC intentionally restricts some actions in or near claims to prevent bypassing **Rule [4]** protections.

**Fix:**  
- Explain that this is expected behavior:
  - Ender pearls require access trust
  - Raid triggers require build trust
  - Claim protections block many grief-prone actions

**Escalate if:**  
- The restriction is happening in the player’s **own** claim unexpectedly  
- The blocked action is preventing a legitimate server-approved activity

---

### Issue: "My animals / villagers / farm are protected, but someone still messed with them"

**Likely cause:**  
The build may be partially unclaimed, or the action involved something outside the normal claim boundary or trust setup.

**Fix:**  
1. Verify the area is fully claimed.
2. Confirm the player did not grant trust to the wrong person.
3. Use CoreProtect if blocks or containers were affected.
4. For entity-related incidents, verify claim coverage and nearby access points.

**Escalate if:**  
- Protected animals or villagers were affected inside a valid claim  
- The issue suggests claim protections are not being enforced correctly

---

### Issue: "My claim disappeared"

**Likely cause:**  
The claim may have expired due to long inactivity, been abandoned, or been removed by staff.

**Fix:**  
- Check claim ownership and inactivity history.
- Confirm whether the claim was abandoned manually or expired under inactivity rules.
- If needed, review staff actions and logs.

**Escalate if:**  
- The player was active recently
- The claim appears to have been removed unexpectedly
- A staff action may need review

---

### Issue: "I can’t create a claim"

**Likely cause:**  
The player may not have enough claim blocks, may be in a world where claims are disabled, or the location may conflict with another protected area.

**Fix:**  
1. Confirm the player is in a claim-enabled world.
2. Have them check whether the land overlaps another claim.
3. Verify they have enough claim blocks available.
4. Have them try again in a different open area.

**Escalate if:**  
- Claim creation fails in normal survival areas with enough blocks available  
- Multiple players report the same issue

---

### Issue: "Explosions / fire / creepers aren’t damaging builds"

**Likely cause:**  
This is intentional. ERRSA MC disables many environmental grief sources to protect player builds and property.

**Fix:**  
- Explain that this is expected server behavior:
  - Claim explosions are blocked
  - Surface creeper and other explosions are blocked
  - Fire spread and fire destruction are disabled

**Escalate if:**  
- Explosions or fire are damaging protected builds when they should not be  
- Damage occurs inconsistently between worlds

---

### Issue: "A player says someone is bypassing protections"

**Likely cause:**  
The suspected player may have been trusted, may be using an allowed interaction type, or staff/admin permissions may be involved.

**Fix:**  
1. Verify the trust list for the claim.
2. Confirm what type of interaction occurred.
3. Check whether the player had legitimate access.
4. If actual grief occurred, handle it under **Rule [4]** and investigate with CoreProtect.

**Escalate if:**  
- Claim protections appear to be bypassed without trust  
- The issue involves admin claims or staff permissions  
- Multiple reports suggest a plugin/config problem
