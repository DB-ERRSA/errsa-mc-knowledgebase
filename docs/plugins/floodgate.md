## Permissions Model

    Bedrock players are treated as normal players after initialization.

- Permissions are applied after PlayerInitialization completes

Floodgate does **not** define gameplay permissions directly.

---

### Admin permissions
- None

Admins do not configure Floodgate directly.

---

### Dev permissions

- UUID and prefix handling

## ERRSA Defaults & Settings

!!! note "ERRSA-specific configuration choices"

    - **Command restrictions:** Enforced until verification completes

These settings ensure Bedrock players follow the **same lifecycle and verification flow** as Java players.
