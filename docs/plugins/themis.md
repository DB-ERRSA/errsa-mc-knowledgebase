# Themis

## Purpose

**Category:** Moderation  

Themis is an **anti-cheat plugin** that detects and prevents common hacks such as fly, speed, reach, and combat cheats. On ERRSA MC it helps staff maintain fair gameplay by **automatically flagging suspicious behavior for review**.

## ERRSA Defaults & Settings

!!! note "ERRSA-specific configuration choices"
- `default.enable: true` — All standard Themis checks are enabled by default so common movement and combat cheats are actively monitored.

- `default.block: true` — Themis is configured to actively **block** cheats, not just log them. This helps stop obvious unfair gameplay immediately.

- `default.block-threshold: 10.0` — Blocking begins once a player reaches a moderate violation score, helping reduce instant punishment from single anomalous movements.

- `default.actions.notify.execution-threshold: 10.0` — Staff notifications begin once behavior is sufficiently suspicious to matter operationally.

- `default.actions.notify.repetition-threshold: 5.0` — Repeat alerts require additional violations so staff are not flooded by identical spam.

- `default.actions.notify.repetition-delay: 10.0` — Notifications are throttled to avoid excessive anti-cheat alert noise during continuous detections.

- `default.actions.notify.commands`:
  - `themis notify §5[Themis] §4%player_name% §cwas flagged for §4%detection_type% §chacks!\n§c[Score: §4%score% §c| Ping: §4%ping% §c| TPS: §4%tps%§c]`  
  — Sends formatted alert messages to staff with relevant investigation context.

- `default.bedrock-only: false` — Themis checks all supported players rather than only Bedrock clients.

- `default.max-ping: -1.0` — No ping cutoff is used. High-ping players are still checked, preventing simple ping-based bypasses.

- `default.min-tps: -1.0` — Checks remain active regardless of server TPS. This maximizes coverage, though staff should interpret alerts carefully during lag.

- `default.violation-expiration: 900.0` — Violations expire after 15 minutes, allowing suspicious behavior to decay over time instead of permanently stacking through normal play.

- `boat_movement: {}` — Uses default behavior for boat-related movement cheats such as BoatFly or BoatSpeed.

- `elytra_flight: {}` — Uses default behavior for Elytra-related movement exploits.

- `horizontal_movement: {}` — Uses default behavior for standard speed and movement checks.

- `illegal_packets: {}` — Uses default behavior for impossible or malformed packet detection.

- `packet_spoof: {}` — Uses default behavior for spoofed packet checks tied to movement exploits like NoFall or Jesus.

- `reach: {}` — Uses default behavior for combat reach detection.

- `tickrate: {}` — Uses default behavior for timer/blink style cheats.

- `vertical_movement: {}` — Uses default behavior for flight, glide, high-jump, and vertical movement checks.

This section documents **intentional deviations from plugin defaults**.

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Themis keeps flagging a player, but they might just be lagging"

**Likely cause:**  
High ping, packet loss, or temporary server lag is causing movement or combat behavior that looks suspicious to the anti-cheat.

**Fix:**  
1. Check the alert details shown in the notification, especially **ping** and **TPS**.  
2. Watch the player directly before taking action.  
3. Use `/themis info <player>` to see whether violations are isolated or continuing to build.  
4. Treat single or inconsistent flags as **watchlist behavior**, not immediate proof of cheating.

**Escalate if:**  
- The player is repeatedly flagged across multiple check types  
- Flags continue even when server performance looks normal  
- Staff are unsure whether the behavior is cheat-related or a false positive
