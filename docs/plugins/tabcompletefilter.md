## ERRSA Defaults & Settings

!!! note "ERRSA-specific configuration choices"

- `op-player-filter-bypass`: `false` — OP players are still filtered (forces proper permission structure) 

- `groups.default`: **Extensive curated command whitelist** — only approved commands appear in tab-complete
  - Includes essentials commands (`/spawn`, `/home`, `/warp`, etc.)  
  - Includes moderation commands (`/report`, `/feedback`)  
  - Includes claim + gameplay commands  

- `Command visibility is whitelist-based` — commands not listed are hidden from players  

- `custom-args.enabled`: `true` — enables controlled tab suggestions
  - `/warp` → suggests `spawn`, `tutorial`, `legacy-lake`  
  - `/help` → limited predefined suggestions  

- `Permission-based command visibility` — players must still have actual command permission even if shown  

- `lang.yml customized` — consistent formatting and messaging prefix (`&6&lTCF`)
